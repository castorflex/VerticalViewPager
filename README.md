##Description

Small library allowing you to have a VerticalViewPager. It's just a copy paste from the v19 ViewPager available in the support lib, where I changed all the left/right into top/bottom and X into Y.

Nothing complicated here, but you can gain some time avoiding rewriting it. 

##Integration

The lib will be available soon on Maven Central. All you have to do is add it on your gradle build:

```xml
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.castorflex.verticalviewpager:library:19.0.0'
}
```
